[Stay in Touch Live Demo](https://stay-in-touch-zil.herokuapp.com)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.
1. Position yourself in a working directory, e.g.: `~/work`
2. Run the following command  `git clone https://github.com/marijanbrvar/stay-in-touch.git && cd stay-in-touch`
3. To install prerequisites, just run `bundle install`
4. Now, we need to migrate the database. We assume you already install the Postgres server on your local machine
5. To enable the database for our application, run the following commands:
```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
```
6. After all these steps are finished, you can run the application by calling `rails server`
7. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/` and sign up with a new user. 

> How it works: you can invite your friend and theatergoer. You can try the app at the link [Stay in Touch Live Demo](https://stay-in-touch-zil.herokuapp.com)
